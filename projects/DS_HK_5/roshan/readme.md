I didn't submit my work earlier because I am still struggling with how to split my data set.

So I have about 100,000 columns each of the following columns for 15 people ;

sequence number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label (this is what I need to classify)

The thing is for each of the people, the number of points I have for each activity is different. Below are some histograms of counts:

Person 1:

Person 2:

So as you can see some labels are underrepresented, and wanted to hear your thoughts on my options or if I could have some time to do a bit more work and submit it for peer review to get their thoughts.

The one option is to combine all 15 people's data into one dataset and then split it 70/30 and start doing some work from there. Or I can try and pick 10 random people's dataset to use for training and then use the other 5 people's data as testing data.  

What are your thoughts?
