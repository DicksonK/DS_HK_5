Sorry for the delay. I caught a cold after class (def coz of the aircon!) and have been spending the last day resting and blowing my nose. I don’t have much but I really need some insights and suggestion on how I should move things further…. My dataset has 5 years of dog popularity ranking and intelligence ranking but I don’t know how to utilise that. I tried to put them into 4 segments. I am trying to analyse the data by Dog Category and find some correlation on no of ailments, life expectancy, total cost etc. Welcome for suggestion! Thanks!!!!!!
