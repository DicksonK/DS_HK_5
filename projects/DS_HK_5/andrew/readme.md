My team is looking into the mouse dynamics classification problem.
The major idea is to read the mouse movement of a user for a period of time (e.g. 20 min) and use these raw data to generate features for user classification. There are some similar research done but we failed to repeat with same result.

My engineer is good in python but new to data science. He did some python code with my input and data analytics idea and made some graphs and analysis as the pdf attached. 
The raw data file and python scripts are in 
In https://github.com/andrwat/DA/tree/master/vhist

The current issue is the pair-wise comparison table shows that the method we used to user is not good. Please feel free to give me comments if you spot anything we can improve.

I intended to use the techniques learned in the class for further analysis but I still need to find time to work on the python syntax etc.
