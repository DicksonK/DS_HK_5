You will find below the link to the 1st draft of the ipython notebook for my final project:

https://gist.github.com/juliebr/97d75994bb75091c7342#file-1st_draft 


Here are the remaining items that I will focus on next week:

- Complete the EDA part, perhaps using output dataset of PCA+ LDA
- Complete the LDA part
- Complete the Random Forest classification section
- create my own out of sample data to see if predictions are correct (for this, my guess is that I need to find tracks that fit into existing labels (i.e. geographical areas  "known by the model"))
- Add more comments/text to walk readers through my project

I have been looking a bit on the Internet about LDA and how to perform it and get indicators about how it suceeded, perhaps you could tell me a bit more about it? 

Any suggestions/comments are greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
