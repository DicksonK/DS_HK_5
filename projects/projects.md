## Ludo - Fanfic Classifier

Most people like the idea to write a book, at some point in their life. Some of them actually try, and a very few manage to get published. Even when published, it seems to be exceptional to sell more than a 1000 books.

What if we could actually assess the potential popularity of a paragraph, synopsis, chapter or book to help authors know where they stand? What if we could match aspiring authors' style to famous author one? What if we could accompany them in the adventure of finishing a book and provide them with insights (hopefully not expectations) about their change of successes?

Based on at least collections of short stories on known themes from fan-fiction.net, if possible other online sources like narrative.ly or maybe even existing, free of rights, digital versions of books, I will discover NLP tools while trying to get a rough version of a success predictor tool for fictions works, be it a complete book, chapter of paragraph. I am planning to look at the following parameters:
- the use of stop-words, per thematic
- the use of punctuation
- the number of characters
To assess the popularity of a fiction work, I will analyze the positivity of reviews on fan-fiction.net, or comments on narrative.ly to give every document an appreciation score.
